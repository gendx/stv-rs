Rust implementation of Single Transferable Vote counting

Usage: stv-rs [OPTIONS] --arithmetic <ARITHMETIC>

Options:
      --package-name <PACKAGE_NAME>
          Package name to show in the election report

      --omega-exponent <OMEGA_EXPONENT>
          Base-10 logarithm of the "omega" value, i.e. `omega = 10^omega_exponent`
          
          [default: 6]

      --arithmetic <ARITHMETIC>
          Arithmetic to use

          Possible values:
          - fixed9:    Fixed-point precisions with 9 decimals
          - bigfixed9: Fixed-point precisions with 9 decimals, backed by a [`BigInt`]
          - exact:     Exact rational arithmetic
          - approx:    Exact rational arithmetic, with rounding of keep factors
          - float64:   64-bit floating-point arithmetic

      --input <INPUT>
          Input ballot file. If no input is provided, fallback to reading from stdin

      --parallel <PARALLEL>
          Enable parallel ballot counting based on the rayon crate
          
          [default: true]
          [possible values: true, false]

      --force-positive-surplus
          Enable a bug-fix in the surplus calculation, preventing it from being negative. Results may differ from Droop.py, but this prevents crashes

      --equalize
          Enable "equalized counting"

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')
